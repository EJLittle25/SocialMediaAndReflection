### Reflection

This was the first visual arts class that I have taken at Duke. This alone was extremely exciting for me because I felt that it was something outside of the box for me due to the fact that I have taken mostly quantitative classes. I had taken coding classes before, but I had never taken anything related to art. This made me really appreciate the conceptual aspects of the class. I liked learning about how new media art was made and the ways that people are able to use technology to advance and enhance their artwork. Especially the art pieces that involved the sounds made from cotton balls and other items spinning. I thought that learning about these concepts and how artists are able to draw inspiration form things around them is super cool. I also wish we were able to dive into the interaction design more. I loved seeing the different things people were able to do with interaction such as making the penguins turn whenever a person walked in front of them. I think it would have been super interesting to have used the Xbox Kinect and start to really experiment with how we can make designs using interaction. At the same time, I think that this was certainly the most confusing part of the class. I really struggled to learn how to use WebSockets and some of the other tools that were introduced at the end. This was frustrating, but I think that if I had more time to develop an understanding of the work, I would have been able to figure it out. This is definitely where I struggled the most. There were also times where I couldn’t put the thoughts in my head into a sketch because I didn’t know how to code certain things, and this was frustrating. The most exciting part of the class was definitely the aesthetic design though. I thought it was great being able to create things that look good and knowing you were the artist behind the pieces.
